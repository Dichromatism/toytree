# Welcome to Toytree!


Welcome to <span style="color:rgba(20%,65%,65%)">**Toytree**</span> a minimalist tree manipulation and plotting library for Python based on <span style="color:rgba(98%,55%,38%)">**Toyplot**</span> ([http://toyplot.readthedocs.io](http://toyplot.rtfd.io)). 


## The Toytree ethos

**Toytree** was conceived with the intention of providing a Python equivalent to the popular tree plotting package **ape** in R, which is rich in features but simple in design. Following the ethos of [Toyplot](http://toyplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), **Toytree** is similarly designed to be a kid-sized library with grownup-sized goals:

+ Elegance: Tree objects are represented with a simple hierarchical structure that is easy to traverse, modify, and annotate. Toytree uses a stripped-down version the Tree (TreeNode) object from the [ete3](http://etetoolkit.org) library.

<p></p>
+ Simplicity: Toytree provides beautiful "out-of-the-box‚Äù figures that look good with minimal stlying, but offers a wide-variety of styling through simple CSS semantics, and can include advanced interactive features through Toyplots interactivity and animation features. 

<p></p>
+ Reproducibility: Toytree plots can be embedded directly in jupyter notebooks, a tool used for reproducible science. Tree figures as well as the code to produce them can be easily embedded in a document alongside other analyses. 

## Jupyter notebooks

If you are not familiar with jupyter-notebooks the best way to get started is to give one a try. You can try out Toytree without having to install anything by clicking the binder link below which will start up a jupyter-notebook running in the cloud with Toytree installed (it may take a minute to load): [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/eaton-lab/toytree)
