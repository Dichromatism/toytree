The toytree ethos
=================

Welcome to **toytree**, a minimalist tree manipulation and plotting library. 
Toytree combines a popular Tree data structure based on the [ete3] library with
modern plotting tools based on the `toyplot <http://toyplot.rtfd.io>`__ plotting 
library. The goal of toytree is to provide a light-weight Python equivalent to  commonly used tree manipulation and plotting libraries in R, and in doing so, to promote further development of phylogenetic methods in Python.

Toytree features
----------------
+ style: beautiful "out-of-the-box‚Äù figures that require minimal styling.
+ customization: extensive style options using CSS semantics. 
+ simplicity: several pre-defined plotting styles (e.g., coalescent, dark-mode).
+ tree manipulation: easily traversable class object. Rooting, ordering, etc.
+ tree statistics: edge lengths, node heights.
+ tree comparisons: cloud tree plotting, Robinson-Fould's calculations.
+ transparency: interactive plots make raw data available as pop-ups.
+ reproducibility: code and plots in jupyter notebooks.
+ extendability: combine with toyplot scatterplots, barplots, colormapping, etc.
